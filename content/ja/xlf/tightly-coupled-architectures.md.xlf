<source xml:lang="en">Tightly coupled architecture is an architectural style where a number of application components are interdependent
(the opposite paradigm of <x id="1"/>loosely coupled architectures<x id="2"/>).
This means that a change in one component will likely impact other components.
It is generally easier to implement than more loosely coupled architectural styles,
but can leave a system more vulnerable to cascading failures.
They also tend to require coordinated rollouts of components
which can become a drag on developer productivity.</source>
