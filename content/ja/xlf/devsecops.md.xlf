<source xml:lang="en">DevSecOps focuses on breaking down team silos and promotes the creation of secure, automated workflows.
When selecting security applications, organizations must take advantage of
automated CI/CD workflows and policy enforcement that empower the developer.
The goal is not to be a blocker but to enforce security policies
while giving users accurate information on how to move their project forward.
When properly implemented, an organization will gain better team communication and
reduce security mishaps and associated costs.</source>
