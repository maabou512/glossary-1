<source xml:lang="en">A distributed system is a collection of autonomous computing elements
connected over a network that appears to users as a single coherent system.
Generally referred to as <x id="1"/>nodes<x id="2"/>, these components can be hardware devices (e.g. computers, mobile phones) or software processes.
Nodes are programmed to achieve a common goal and, to collaborate, they exchange messages over the network.</source>

<source xml:lang="en">Numerous modern applications today are so big they'd need supercomputers to operate.
Think Gmail or Netflix. No single computer is powerful enough to host the entire application.
By connecting multiple computers, compute power becomes nearly limitless.
Without distributed computing, many applications we rely on today wouldn't be possible.</source>
