A load balancer sits in front of a scaled microservice and ensures that no one instance gets the bulk of the requests.
Load balancers can be software or hardware-based.</source>

<source xml:lang="en">Modern applications and websites generally serve hundreds of thousands of simultaneous end-user requests.
To handle all those requests, applications are often scaled horizontally.
But horizontal scaling introduces a new challenge. How do you distribute incoming traffic to all services equally?
This is where load balancers come in.</source>

<source xml:lang="en">Load balancers dynamically distribute all incoming requests among multiple services, ensuring that no one service gets the bulk of it while others only get a few or none.
In short, it spreads the load across multiple services, following a defined schema (i.e., evenly or percentage-based).
Load balancers are essential to an application's overall performance and, ultimately, the user experience.</source>
