<source xml:lang="en">In traditional on-premise setups, organizations often struggle with effective computing resource usage.
Data centers have to be built for potential peak demand, even if it's only needed 1% of the time.
During lower demand, these compute resources are idle.
And, if the workload spikes beyond the expected demand,
there is a shortage of computing resources to process the workload.
This lack of scalability leads to increased costs and ineffective resource usage.</source>
