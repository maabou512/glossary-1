<source xml:lang="en">Cloud computing is a model that offers compute resources like CPU, network, and disk capabilities on-demand over the internet.
Cloud computing gives users the ability to access and use computing power in a remote physical location.
Cloud providers like AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, and others all offer third parties
the ability to rent access to compute resources in multiple geographic locations.</source>

<source xml:lang="en">Organizations traditionally faced two main problems when attempting to expand their use of computing power.
They either acquire, support, design, and pay for facilities
to host their physical servers and network or expand and maintain those facilities.
Cloud computing allows organizations to outsource some portion of their computing needs to another organization.</source>
