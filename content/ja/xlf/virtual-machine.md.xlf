<source xml:lang="en">A virtual machine (VM) is a computer and its operating system
that is not bound to a particular piece of hardware.
VMs rely on <x id="1"/>virtualization<x id="2"/> to carve a single physical computer into multiple virtual computers.
That separation allows organizations and infrastructure providers to
easily create and destroy VMs without impacting the underlying hardware.</source>

<source xml:lang="en">Virtual machines take advantage of virtualization.
When a <x id="1"/>bare metal<x id="2"/> machine is bound to a single operating system,
how well the machine's resources can be used is somewhat limited.
Also, when an operating system is bound to a single physical machine,
its availability is directly tied to that hardware.
If the physical machine is offline due to maintenance or hardware failures, so is the operating system.</source>

<source xml:lang="en">With no new hardware to be bought, installed, or configured to support it,
provisioning time for a new computer is dramatically improved.
VMs allow you to use your existing physical hardware resources better
by placing multiple virtual machines on a single physical machine.
Not bound to a particular physical machine, VMs are also more resilient than physical machines.
When a physical machine needs to go offline,
the VMs running on it can be moved to another machine with little to no downtime</source>
