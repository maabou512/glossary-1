The buildings housing datacenters are equipped to maintain service even during adverse events, including generators that provide power during outages and powerful air conditioning that keep the heat-producing computers cool.</source>

<source xml:lang="en">But computers have limited resources (disk, RAM, and CPU).
That means that applications running on them have the same hard constraints, limiting the kinds of applications it can run.
Before datacenters, the scale of the application was constrained by the capacity of the computer it was running on.
But if you think about apps at scale like Gmail or Netflix (the app, not the user interface you have on your phone or computer), those need more computing capacity than any one computer can provide.
And that's where datacenters come in.</source>
