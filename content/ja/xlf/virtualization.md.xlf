<source xml:lang="en">Virtualization, in the context of cloud native computing,
refers to the process of taking a physical computer, sometimes called a server,
and allowing it to run multiple isolated operating systems.
Those isolated operating systems and their dedicated compute resources (CPU, memory, and network) are
referred to as virtual machines or VMs.
When we talk about a <x id="1"/>virtual machine<x id="2"/>, we’re talking about a software-defined computer.
Something that looks and acts like a real computer but is sharing hardware with other virtual machines.
<x id="3"/>Cloud computing<x id="4"/> is primarily powered by virtualization technology.
As an example, you can lease a "computer" from AWS – that computer is actually a VM.</source>

<source xml:lang="en">Apps running on virtual machines have no awareness that they are sharing a physical computer.
Virtualization also allows the users of the datacenter to spin up a new "computer" (aka a VM) in minutes
without worrying about the physical constraints of adding a new computer to a datacenter.
VMs also enable users to speed up the time to get a new virtual computer.</source>
