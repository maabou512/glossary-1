<source xml:lang="en">Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a protocol designed to provide increased security to communication over a network.&#13;
It ensures the secure delivery of data sent over the Internet,&#13;
avoiding possible monitoring and/or alteration of the data.&#13;
This protocol is widely used in applications such as messaging, e-mail, etc.</source>

<source xml:lang="en">Without TLS, sensitive information such as browsing habits, e-mail correspondence, online chats, and conferencing calls can&#13;
easily be traced and modified by others during the transmission.&#13;
Enabling server and client applications to support TLS ensures that&#13;
data transmitted between them is encrypted and not viewable by third parties.</source>

<source xml:lang="en">TLS uses a combination of encoding techniques that provide security while transmitting data over a network.&#13;
TLS allows for an encrypted connection between a client application and a server, like a web browser and a banking site.&#13;
It also allows client applications to positively identify the server they are calling to,&#13;
which reduces the risk of a client talking to a fraudulent site.&#13;
This ensures that third parties are unable to see and monitor data transmitted between applications using TLS,&#13;
which protects sensitive and private information such as credit card numbers, passwords, location, etc.</source>
