<source xml:lang="en">Scalability refers to how well a system can grow.
That is increasing the ability to do whatever the system is supposed to do.
For example, a <x id="1"/>Kubernetes<x id="2"/> <x id="3"/>cluster<x id="4"/> scales by
increasing or reducing the number of <x id="5"/>containerized<x id="6"/> apps,
but that scalability depends on several factors.
How many <x id="7"/>nodes<x id="8"/> does it have, how many <x id="9"/>containers<x id="10"/> can each node handle,
and how many records and operations can the control plane support?</source>

<source xml:lang="en">A scalable system makes it easy to add more capacity.
We differentiate between two scaling approaches.
On the one hand, there is <x id="1"/>horizontal scaling<x id="2"/> which adds more nodes to handle increased load.
In contrast, in <x id="3"/>vertical scaling<x id="4"/> individual nodes are made more powerful to perform more transactions
(e.g. by adding more memory or CPU to an individual machine).
A scalable system is able to change easily and meet user needs.</source>
