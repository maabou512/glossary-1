<source xml:lang="en">The Cloud Native Glossary aims to make the cloud native space — which is notorious for its complexity — simpler for people by making it easier to understand,
not only for technologists but also for people on the business side.
To achieve that, we focus on simplicity (e.g., simple language free from buzzwords, examples anyone using technology can relate to, leaving unnecessary details out).
The Glossary is a project led by the CNCF Business Value Subcommittee (BVS).</source>
