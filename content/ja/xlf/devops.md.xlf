<source xml:lang="en">DevOps is a methodology in which teams own the entire process from application development to production operations, hence DevOps.
It goes beyond implementing a set of technologies and requires a complete shift in culture and processes.
DevOps calls for groups of engineers that work on small components (versus an entire feature), decreasing handoffs – a common source of errors.</source>

work was generally fragmented between multiple groups.
This led to numerous handoffs and long lead times.
Each time a component or update was ready, it was placed in a queue for the next team.
Because individuals only worked on one small piece of the project, this approach led to a lack of ownership.
Their goal was to get the work to the next group, not deliver the right functionality to the customer
— a clear misalignment of priorities.</source>
