With FaaS, users manage only functions and data while the cloud provider manages the application.
This allows developers to get the functions they need without paying for services when code isn’t running.</source>

<source xml:lang="en">In a traditional on-premises scenario, a business manages and maintains its own data center.
The business must invest in servers, storage, software, and other technologies
and potentially hire an IT staff or contractors to purchase, manage, and upgrade all the equipment and licenses.
The data center has to be built to meet peak demand, even when workloads decline and those resources stand idle.
Conversely, if the business grows quickly, the IT department might struggle to keep up.
Under a standard <x id="1"/>Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)<x id="2"/> cloud computing model,
users pre-purchase capacity units, meaning you pay a public cloud provider for always-on server components to run your apps.
It’s the user’s responsibility to scale up server capacity during times of high demand
and scale down when that capacity is no longer needed.
The cloud infrastructure necessary to run an app is active even when the app isn’t being used.</source>
