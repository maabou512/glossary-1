<source xml:lang="en">Loosely coupled architecture is an architectural style
where the individual components of an application are built independently from one another
(the opposite paradigm of <x id="1"/>tightly coupled architectures<x id="2"/>).
Each component, sometimes referred to as a <x id="3"/>microservice<x id="4"/>, is built to perform a specific function
in a way that can be used by any number of other services.
This pattern is generally slower to implement than tightly coupled architecture
but has a number of benefits, particularly as applications scale.</source>
