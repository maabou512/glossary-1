<source xml:lang="en">Traditionally, on-premise environments provided compute resources in a fairly bespoke way.

often relying heavily on manual provisioning for infrastructure, like <x id="3"/>virtual machines<x id="4"/> and services.
This, in turn, constrained developers and their applications to that specific datacenter.
Applications that weren't designed for the cloud couldn't take advantage of a cloud environment’s resiliency and scaling capabilities.
For example, apps that require manual intervention to start correctly cannot scale automatically,
nor can they be automatically restarted in the event of a failure.</source>
