<source xml:lang="en">By default, a network will allow anyone to enter and depart as long as they follow the network's routing rules.
Because of this default behavior, securing a network is challenging.
For example, in a <x id="1"/>microservices<x id="2"/>-based banking app, the services communicate with one another
by transmitting highly sensitive financial data through their network.
A malicious actor may infiltrate the network, intercept communication, and do damage if there was no firewall in place.</source>

All traffic is filtered, and any traffic coming from untrustworthy or suspect sources is blocked
— only traffic configured to be accepted gets in.
Firewalls establish a barrier between secured and controlled internal trusted networks.</source>
