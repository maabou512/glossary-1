<source xml:lang="en">Version control systems work to address the following problems,
backing up a document or codebase as it changes over time,
allowing multiple users to resolve conflicts when there are overlapping changes, and
storing a log of changes over time.
Application code can often be complex and critical to key business processes,
so it is important to track who changed what, when it was changed, and why.
Also, many, if not most applications, are modified by multiple developers,
and there are often conflicts between the changes introduced by different developers.</source>
